# <span style="color:DodgerBlue">Project Release Workflow</span>

## Description

This Project works on Trunk-Based Development. Any Development is handles on the "main"-branch, and when a release is ready it is published to the "releases"-branch and a tag for Version-Identification is added.
If a Hotfix is necessary, it will be conducted on the "releases"-branch, otherwise any changes will be made on the "main"-branch. 
Should the need arise, feature-based branches will be created.
